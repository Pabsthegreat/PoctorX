## ProctorX
Non Invasive Proctoring

## About Project
ProctorX is a complete end-end secure test-taking platform with all anti-cheat measures including behavioral analysis like mouse and keyboard actions used to assign risk scores to users. While secure, ProctorX is non-invasive, meaning we do not record the video and audio of the test taker and we comply to all privacy laws. We have also made a chrome extension, ProctorXtension to enable users to avail our proctoring innovation without visiting our platform. 

This project is open source and any one can contribute to make it better and enhance and add any new features.

This project was created in #The Great Bengaluru Hackathon 2025.
